<h1>Young Rewired State 2013</h1>
<h3 class="meta">26 Aug 2013</h3>
<p>After months of planning, Monday 5th August finally came around and the 2013 Festival of Code had begun. I set 
off on Monday morning feeling excited but mostly nervous about meeting the other attendees. When I arrived at the 
Hackspace I was greeted with a locked door. I had arrived early in the hope that I would have more time to find 
my centre. Thankfully a few minutes later Ben Hayman, our centre lead, arrived. Although, Ben didn&#39;t know the 
code for the door either. So there we were, stood outside our centre watching as more and more people arrived. 
Eventually, one of the cleaners of the building showed up, and she was able to let us in. </p>

<p>We all sat down in the sofa room - Ben played Emma&#39;s video then we all introduced ourselves and began sharing 
ideas. We had come up with a few ideas but not many, so off we went to research the open data. We regrouped about 
30 minutes later and chose our 4 favourite hacks (4 was our limit). Ben stuck post it notes around the room with 
a description of our favourite hacks and we had to go to the one we wanted to work on. I chose the worldwide lost 
and found app option. Our team consisted of Jacob Walker, Barnaby Taylor, Adam Barcock, George Streten (our 
remote participant from Southampton) and Daniel Tomlinson. Although, Dan decided to drop out to work on his own 
entry, Project Hermes. Day 1 went by pretty quickly and we didn&#39;t get much done, but when Tuesday morning arrived 
we were raring to go!</p>

<p>Firstly, Jacob set up a Kanban board on a big whiteboard he found in the Hackspace. We were much more organised 
and on task now. Me and Barnaby worked on front end, Jacob on the back end, Adam on mobile integration and George 
on marketing. Slowly we made progress. We were expecting a visit from the one and only Ben Nunney on Tuesday 
evening but unfortunately after an incident on the motorway, he was unable to attend. Wednesday and Thursday saw 
a visit from the kind people at Esendex. It wasn&#39;t until Thursday that we chose the name for our product. Our 
final decision was Reunitem. Finally, after a long week we boarded our coach to Birmingham on Friday with a semi-
finished project.</p>

<p>We arrived in Birmingham and found George lurking in the coach station. We were the first team to arrive at the 
Custard Factory. After dropping off our bags, we headed to the Bullring for some lunch, sticky notes and 
extension leads. We spent about an hour in the Apple Store chatting to Sam the Apple Genius. George spent the 
duration of our visit opening his YouTube channel on as many Apple products as possible. After leaving the store, 
we headed to Subway for a bite to eat. Having picked up everything we needed, we headed back to the Custard 
Factory and got to work, with lots more people having arrived now. Tea was served at 17:00 and afterwards we went 
to the talks. I found Ben Nunney&#39;s talk in the theatre but unfortunately missed the start of the GitHub talk.</p>

<p>Saturday morning came around and we still weren&#39;t ready for our presentation, far from it. We worked on creating 
a slideshow in Google Drive to explain the concept of our product and when the time for our presentation came 
around we showed what we could and somehow we managed to persuade the judges of Kaleidoscope - they put us in the 
final! On Sunday, everybody piled into Space 2 off the final. We were nominated in the &#39;Best Example of Design&#39; 
category. Truth be told, it could of gone better - Aral Balkan gives quite a grilling. The judges did seem to 
like my Missing Internet Connection joke and our awesome Promo video produced by George but apart from that, we 
weren&#39;t expecting much. The results were announced and we didn&#39;t win anything. Although, following some positive 
feedback on Twitter, we have decided to keep working on Reunitem!</p>

<p>Overall, the Festival of Code has been an amazing experience for me and I cannot wait until next year. I also 
picked up a lot of freebies including a Twilio T-shirt, which is awesome! I will keep you updated on our progress 
as we continue to make Reunitem. All I have left to say is bring on next year, I am counting down the days until 
Young Rewired State 2014!</p>
